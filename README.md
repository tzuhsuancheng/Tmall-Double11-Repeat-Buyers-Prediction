## Problem description
- Topic: Predicting Loyal Customers for Sellers on Tmall to Increase Return on Promoting Cost

- **Business Goal**

Sellers on Tmall usually use discounts and coupons to attract customers, but most of these customers are one-time buyers which causes low return on the promotion cost. By identifying who are the potential loyal buyers to this seller, the seller can spend the promotion cost on potential loyal buyers. However, implementing this idea might lead to the ignorance of the buyers on the long tail. The increase of return on the promotion cost would be considered a success.

- **Analytics/Data Mining Goal**

To achieve the business goal, we need to predict how likely this buyer will be the loyal customer to this seller after his/her purchase so it is a supervised and predictive task. The outcome variable of interest is the probability of the customer will be loyal to the seller.
